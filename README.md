# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

In this challenge, I took existing code and refactored it to use semantic HTML and consolidate the CSS. Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses, ensuring that people with disabilities and/or socio-economic restrictions have access to their website. Accessible websites are better optimized for search engines, and help companies avoid litigation.
